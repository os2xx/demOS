/*
 * TAKE NOTE(AII, MG)
 * In Linux, an executable stored on disk is called a 
 * program,
 * and a program loaded into memory and running is 
 * called a process. 
 * When a process is started, it is given a unique 
 * number called process ID (PID)
 * that identifies that process to the system
 * 
 * Each process is assigned a parent process ID (PPID) 
 * that tells which process started it. 
 * The PPID is the PID of the processâ€™s parent.
 *
 * To see PID and PPID in current process you can use 
 * getpid() and getppid()
 *
 * sleep() function delays program execution for a 
 * given number of seconds
