# OS Week 01 Assignment #1

## Virtual Debian Guest Requirement

The virtual machine (guest) needs a computer host (DeskTop or LapTop) with at 
least 1 GB for each CPU core/thread. 
E.g., a computer with four cores will need at least 4 GB of memory. 
You also need at least 64 GB of disk space and a 32 GB backup flash disk. 
If your Windows "C:" drive is almost full, consider using drive "D:".

To set up a virtual Debian guest, visit:

  * Hostname: Your GitHub Account (e.g. cbkadal)
  * Username: Your GitHub Account (e.g. cbkadal)
  * Remember: You are not <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger;">cbkadal</span>!
    Replace <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger;">cbkadal</span> with your GitHub Account.
