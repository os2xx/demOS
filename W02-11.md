# Backup Your SSH and GPG Keys!

Genuine (ORI) Computer Science students back up their KEYS! 
Fake (KW) students keep sobbing because they are losing their keys.
Therefore, create a "myBACKUP/" directory.
Next, copy your SSH keys:

```
mkdir -pv $HOME/myBACKUP/
cd $HOME/myBACKUP/
/bin/cp -vf $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519     .
/bin/cp -vf $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub .
ls -al

```

What is your GPG key-id? Cbkadal's is "<b>60914D29C01C81F1</b>," but 
<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger;">you are not cbkadal!</span>

```
gpg --list-key --keyid-format long

```

Export your Secret KEY (e.g. for cbkadal):

```
KEYID=60914D29C01C81F1

mkdir -pv $HOME/myBACKUP/
cd $HOME/myBACKUP/
gpg --armor --yes --output mySECRETgnupgKEY.asc --export-secret-keys $KEYID
ls -al

```

For WEEK 02, create file WEEK02-MD5SUM.txt (checksum).
For other WEEKs, swap W02 with the appropriate week number.

```
WEEK=02

mkdir -pv $HOME/myBACKUP/
cd $HOME/myBACKUP/
rm -vf WEEK??-MD5SUM.txt
md5sum id_ed25519 id_ed25519.pub mySECRETgnupgKEY.asc | tee WEEK$WEEK-MD5SUM.txt
ls -al

```

For WEEK02:
copy file "WEEK02-MD5SUM.txt" into folder "$HOME/RESULT/W02/", 
together with other files like "WEEK02-00-BASIC.txt", etc.
For other WEEKs, swap W02 with the appropriate week number.

```
WEEK=02

mkdir -pv $HOME/RESULT/W$WEEK/
mkdir -pv $HOME/myBACKUP/
cd $HOME/myBACKUP/
cp -v WEEK$WEEK-MD5SUM.txt $HOME/RESULT/W$WEEK/
ls -al $HOME/RESULT/W$WEEK/

```

## WARNING

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger;">Never ever</span>
submit your files like "mySECRETgnupgKEY.asc" and "id_ed25519"!<br>
By the way, keep a copy of those keys OUTSIDE your virtual guest!
