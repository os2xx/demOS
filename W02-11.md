# Backup Your SSH and GPG Keys!

Genuine (ORI) Computer Science students back up their KEYS! 
Fake (KW) students keep sobbing because they are losing their keys.

[&#x213C;](#idxXXX)<br id="idx001">

## Step 1: set the current week. E.g., for Week 02:

```
WEEK=02

```

In another week, the number will obviously be different.

[&#x213C;](#idxXXX)<br id="idx002">

## Step 2: Find your GnuPG ID. E.g.,:

```
gpg --list-key --keyid-format long


```

[&#x213C;](#idxXXX)<br id="idx003">

## Step 3: Set your GnuPG ID. E.g., for CBKADAL:

```
KEYID=60914D29C01C81F1

```

Remember, <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger;">you are not cbkadal!</span>

## Step 4: Set and go to "myBACKUP/" directory. 

```
mkdir -pv $HOME/myBACKUP/
ls -al $HOME/myBACKUP/

```

[&#x213C;](#idxXXX)<br id="idx005">

## Step 5: If necessary, copy or set all changed keys.


```
/bin/cp -vf $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519     $HOME/myBACKUP/

/bin/cp -vf $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub $HOME/myBACKUP/

gpg --armor --yes --output $HOME/myBACKUP/mySECRETgnupgKEY.asc --export-secret-keys $KEYID

ls -al  $HOME/myBACKUP/

```

[&#x213C;](#idxXXX)<br id="idx006">

## Step 6: Create a "PROOF" file for the WEEK.

```
pushd $HOME/myBACKUP/
rm -vf  WEEK??-MD5SUM.txt
md5sum id_ed25519 id_ed25519.pub mySECRETgnupgKEY.asc | tee WEEK$WEEK-MD5SUM.txt
popd

```

[&#x213C;](#idxXXX)<br id="idx007">

## Step 7: Copy the "PROOF file.

```
pushd $HOME/myBACKUP/
mkdir -pv $HOME/RESULT/W$WEEK/
cp -v WEEK$WEEK-MD5SUM.txt $HOME/RESULT/W$WEEK/
ls -al $HOME/RESULT/W$WEEK/
popd

```

[&#x213C;](#idxXXX)<br id="idx008">

## Last Step: Save/Backup/Copy Your Keys Somewhere Else

It is highly recommended that you secure all the contents of the "myBACKUP/" 
folder to an external medium such as a flash drive.

## WARNING

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger;">Never ever</span>
submit your files like "mySECRETgnupgKEY.asc" and "id_ed25519"!<br>
By the way, keep a copy of those keys OUTSIDE your virtual guest!
