# SP Week 00 Assignment #8: Finishing

* Update "mylog.txt". For e.g., see cbkadal's <br><https://cbkadal.github.io/sp241/TXT/mylog.txt>
* Write script "myscript.sh" or copy <br><https://cbkadal.github.io/sp241/TXT/myscript.sh>.
  The use of the script is as follows:
  * Create checksum file "SHA256SUM" of folder "$HOME/git/sp241/TXT/"
  * Signing checksum to file "SHA256SUM.asc"
  * You are not <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger;">cbkadal</span>!
    What is YOUR public-key ID? READ the script, before using cbkadal's "myscript.sh"!
  * REC2 is cbkadal's public key ID.  Replace REC2 with your Public Key ID!

```
# ####################### Replace REC2 ####
REC2="60914D29C01C81F1"
# ####################### ####### #### ####

```

* For WEEK00, run and confirm WEEK00:
  * Make sure that all SHA CHECKSUMS are "OK", and verify "gpg: Good signature".


```
bash myscript.sh 0
