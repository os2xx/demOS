# OS Week 01 Assignment #4: Finishing

* Update your "links.md" file. For e.g., see cbkadal's <https://cbkadal.github.io/os242/LINKS/>{:target="_blank"}
* Create a new file "TXT/myupdate.txt" inside your "os242" repository.
  * Upto 24 hours after the Week 01 deadline, the content of "myupdate.txt" should be:
    * OS242W01 (ALL CAPITAL LETTERS!)
    * When submitting the weekly assignments, the content of "TXT/myupdate.txt" should match 
      the week of the assignment. I.E., OS242W01 for WEEK01, OS242W02 for WEEK02, and beyond. 
      Without a proper "TXT/myupdate.txt," your assignment grade will be significantly reduced.
  * For e.g., see cbkadal's <https://cbkadal.github.io/os242/TXT/myupdate.txt>{:target="_blank"}
* Update "mylog.txt". For e.g., see cbkadal's <https://cbkadal.github.io/os242/TXT/mylog.txt>{:target="_blank"}
