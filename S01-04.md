# SP Week 01 Assignment #4: DJBX33A in C and Shell Script

DJBX33A is a variant of the DJB hash function created by Daniel J. Bernstein. 
The "33" in the name refers to the number of rounds used in the hashing process.

* Create folder "W01/" inside the "sharesp241/" repo. E.g., for "cbkadal" it would be "cbkadal/W01/".
* Create (touch) empty files "Makefile", "djbx33a.c", and "djbx33a.sh".
* Implement DJBX33A in c-language (dbjx33a.c) and bash script (djbx33a.sh).
* Use the string "The DJBX33A result with C and Bash should be the same" (standard output).
