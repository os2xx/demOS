* **SIGN UP** if you have no GitHub.com account.

    Fortunately, GitHub accounts are not.

## Default Branch: **main** or **master**?

* More details at <https://doit.vlsm.org/030.html#idx07>
* The current GitHub DEFAULT Branch is "main."
  * In the past, the default branch was "master."
  * To be "politically correct," GitHub has changed the default branch
    name from ”master” to ”main.”
  * Many past examples here have been using the "master" branch name.
  * Therefore -- to be consistent -- the "master" branch name will
    continue to be used.
  * Feel free to use either “main” or “master.” However, 
    it would help if you did not alter your branch name once it has been chosen.
  * To change the default branch name, click "settings."
